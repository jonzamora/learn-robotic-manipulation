# Learn MuJoCo

## Motivation

I often see MuJoCo environments for Robot Learning, but seldom have I looked under the hood to understand how MuJoCo works. This repository will serve as my learning playground for MuJoCo.

Some great examples of MuJoCo-based robot learning environments include:

1. [RoboHive](https://github.com/vikashplus/robohive) - A unified framework for robot learning
2. [RoboPianist](https://github.com/google-research/robopianist) - Dexterous Piano Playing with Deep Reinforcement Learning
3. [DeepMind Control Suite](https://github.com/google-deepmind/dm_control/tree/main/dm_control/suite) - A set of continuous control tasks with a standardised structure and interpretable rewards
4. [RL-ViGen](https://github.com/gemcollector/RL-ViGen) - A Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Visual Generalization

I will update this repository as I continue to learn more about MuJoCo. Stay Tuned!
