# Learn Robotic Manipulation

## Introduction

This repository will be my playground for learning more about Robotic Manipulation. 

I will be following the great [Russ Tedrake's](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/russt.html) Fall 2023 offering of [Robotic Manipulation](https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/Fall2023/index.html) at MIT to learn more about this amazing subject!

## Resources

The Robotic Manipulation course has public materials, including:
